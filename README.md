# JS_Puzzles

This repository contains my personal attempts at solving the monthly [Jane Street puzzle](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/). My goal is to document my thinking, explore different solution methods, and practice communicating mathematical reasoning clearly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These solutions are **not guaranteed to be correct**. They reflect my own reasoning and approach to each problem. If you're looking for authoritative solutions, please refer to Jane Street‚Äôs official puzzle archives and solutions at the link above.

## Purpose

- Develop and showcase problem-solving ability
- Build clear, readable explanations of mathematical and computational methods
- Track progress over time by documenting attempts (whether successful or not)

## Structure

Each puzzle is placed in its own file or notebook, with explanations written in Markdown (rendered with HTML for GitHub compatibility). Where appropriate, code (Python/SymPy) is included to verify or assist in solving.
